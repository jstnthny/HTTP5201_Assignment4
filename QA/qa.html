            <h2>Code Linting</h2>
            <p>Code linters are utilized to help validate code. Code Linters differ from traditional validators because it catches mistakes and errors
                that are still "technically" allowed but are not exactly up to coding standards.

                For this site I installed <a href="https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started">ESLint</a> which is a tool for identifying and reporting patterns found
                in the ECMAScript/JavaScript code.

            <h2>Unit Testing</h2>
            <p>
                Unit testing is one of the most common types of tests that decelopers write. The way unit testing works is by importing a file into a test file
                and using a testing framework or assertion library to write these tests and by using node to run them. 
            </p>

            <h2>Git & Version Control</h2>
            <p>
                Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to code. The most popular and commonly used distributed version control system is git.

            <p>
                This website was made using version control while every major change would be pushed to a git repository. The repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/justin-abante/HTTP5201_Assignment4">here</a>.
